So I am still writing random shit now to break your apps in my malicious ways. I wonder if anyone will actually handle this case. I sure as hell wouldnt. Who the fuck actually spends the time to write this long a description about a dumb event called French Fried holy fuck. Btw I hope you arent actually reading this when you should be coding the solution to fixing your description box that just broke due to my malicious test script. Unless of course it worked in which case, you should probably stop reading this anyway because holy fuck this is a long motha fucking description. It is called French Fried. Starts at 13am. Be there."
